# Vizcab front end challenge by Omar Amara

## How to use the app.
1. Clone the repository.
(not tested with npm)
2. yarn install
3. yarn build for production
Or use yarn dev for a development server
4. (optional if yarn dev is used). Serve the app built on the folder dist
5. Start the backend delivered by Vizcab.
6. Use the app

Make sure the backend is serving on the port 3000 or modify in the Building.vue component the port in the fetch function.
I may also upload the video of me coding the app live.
