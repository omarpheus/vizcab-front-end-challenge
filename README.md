# Vizcab front end challenge by Omar Amara

## How to use the app.
(not tested with npm)
1. yarn install
2. yarn build for production
Or use yarn dev for a development server
3. Serve the app built on the folder dist

Make sure the backend is serving on the port 3000 or modify in the Building.vue component the port in the fetch function.
I may also upload the video of me coding the app live.
